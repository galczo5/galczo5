### Hi there 👋

Who I am?
It's a good question.

I'm a frontend developer, but I like to code, and I'm open to backend and other technologies as well.

I'm the author of [mythical-angular.dev](https://mythical-angular.dev/).

I'm a conference speaker since 2019, see my [conferences log](./CONFERENCES.md).

I like to cook 🍕Check out my [recipes repo](https://github.com/galczo5/recipes).

How to reach me? GitHub or Medium is the fastest way to reach me.
